# Javaculus : math library for Java

Javaculus is a math library with many useful functions : AI tools like gradient descent, a whole section
dedicated to calculus, vectors and a bit of algebra as well.

This is maintained by me (lockuso) and as I'm the only one coding this, there might be a lot of errors
and bugs. Report them because I ain't know if they exist until you report them.
