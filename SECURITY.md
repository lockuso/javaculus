## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability by the snapchat handle named in CONTRIBUTING.md, by email or direct message. Or just raise an Issue on the main repo.

If a vulnerability is found in a different branch of the library not managed by me, this is not my responsibility until it is pulled into the main branch.
